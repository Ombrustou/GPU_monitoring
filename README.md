## Introduction

The GPU Monitoring repository contains the development of AURORA, a comprehensive tool for monitoring and analyzing the utilization of GPUs on remote machines. AURORA provides real-time monitoring of GPU activity and generates detailed reports for performance analysis.

## Components

This repository is organized into the following subdirectories, each focusing on a specific aspect of AURORA:

- [API](./API/README.md): This directory contains the API module responsible for handling communication between the monitoring tool and the remote machines.

- [Gathering DATA](./Gathering_DATA/README.md): Here, you'll find the module responsible for gathering GPU utilization data from the remote machines.

- [Display](./Display/README.md): This directory contains the module responsible for displaying real-time GPU activity and generating visualizations.

- [Data Storage](./data_storage/README.md): Here, you'll find the module responsible for storing and managing the collected GPU utilization data.

Please refer to the respective README files in each subdirectory for detailed information on their functionalities, usage, and configuration.

## Getting Started

To get started with AURORA, please follow the instructions provided in the README files of each subdirectory. It is recommended to go through the README files sequentially to understand the setup and usage of each component.
